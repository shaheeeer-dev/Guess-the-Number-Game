# 🎮 Guess The Number - Java Console Game (OOP Edition)

Welcome to **Guess The Number**, a simple yet fun Java console game where you try to guess the number randomly selected by the computer within 10 attempts.

---

## 🧠 Game Concept

- The computer randomly picks a number between **0 and 100**.
- Your job is to **guess the correct number** within **10 tries**.
- After each guess, you'll get a hint:
  - 🔼 *"Too high!"*
  - 🔽 *"Too low!"*
  - ✅ *"Correct!"*
- Your score is calculated based on how quickly you guess:
  - `Score = 100 - (Number of Guesses × 10)`
- After the game ends, you can choose to **play again**.
